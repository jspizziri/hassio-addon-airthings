# Set out mac addresses for Airthings devices to use. If you have multiple
# devices you can set out multiple [[devices]] blocks each with "mac" set. Each
# device can then have various sensors associated with it, and you can set out
# the values for each sensor that will be sent to Home Assistant through mqtt
# discovery.
#
# If you want to discover your devices, comment out the [[devices]] block and
# then when you run the script it will first try searching for Airthings
# devices. Note that it can take a few tries to find a device, so keep an eye
# on the output from the script and run it a few times.
#
# See https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sensor and the rest of the
# Home Assistant documentation for what attributes can be set for these sensors.
